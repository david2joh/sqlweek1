What are wildcards in MySQL? How are they useful?

Wildcards allow pattern matching in searches.
Wildcards VARY from implementation to implementation.
For mySQL
In a SELECT WHERE LIKE 
% zero or single character
_ any single character

Examples:If my potential result set was yellow, yelp, yep, yowl
            ye% matches yellow, yelp , yep
            ye_ matches yep



Research all the operators that can be used in a SQL WHERE clause. What do they each do?

() - parathesis         :  change order of operations
/,*,+,-                 :  Mathmatical operations
||                      :  Concatination
= , < , > , <= , >=     :  Equality operations
[NOT] LIKE , IS 
[NOT]NULL,  , [NOT] IN  :  Pattern, NULL, and SET comparisons (NOT may be applied)
BETWEEN                 :  Range comparisons
!= , <>                 :  NOT equal to
NOT                     :  Negation
AND                     :  Logical AND
